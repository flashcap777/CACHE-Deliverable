The scene contains three virtual humans designed to showcase the inclusion of task requirements for the walk-by interaction system. The humans are all variations of the open-source FBX model "Remy" from Mixamo. They walk forward into a tunnel which loops them to the opposite end of the scene indefinitely.

The Remy wearing a green shirt at the start will continually walk and turn to meet the player at eye level only when the user looks at them during the walk-by.

The Remy with a magenta shirt will do the same, this time stopping when in the player's view, to allow closer inspection of the eye movement, and head, neck, and body alignment.

Finally, the Remy with the blue shirt does not move, and instead waits for the player to "walk by," and look at them, maintaining eye contact while playing a more complex animation.
